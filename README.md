Computercraft MC related programs. These programs were written in 1.7.10.

## How to Install
1. Install the pastebin fix found in `pastebinFix.md`
2. Upload the code to pastebin (use a self-deleting/private paste so there aren't a million outdated copies floating around).
3. Take the characters from the pastebin URL and in your computer run `pastebin get <pastebin_characters> <filename_to_save>`.
4. Change configuration at the top of the file if necessary.
5. Run the program by typing the name of the file. Alternatively rename the file to "startup" by typing `rename <filename> startup`, and any time you boot the computer it will run automatically (type `reboot`).
